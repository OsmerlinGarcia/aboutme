# aboutme
This is a page about me.
My name is Osmerlin Garcia, I am from the Dominican Republic, moved to Canada when I was 14. It was a big change but I got used to it with time. 
As time went by I started to get into drawing, and doing album covers for local artist where I lived, I then decided to take it in St Clair. I also do music, I have my own recording studio in the house, I hope to maybe get my music heard by millions one day. I am also a Jehovah Witness,I believe in God and I try my best to do what he likes us humans to do, and would like to maybe move to a different country one day to preach to more poeple about my faith in Jehovah and what he has prepare for our future.
